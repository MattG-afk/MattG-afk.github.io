As I've gone through the labs and hit a road block. I now constantly ask myself what little thing am I missing when it comes to the most current lab it ends up being a a small ordering of initializing. What I find specifically interesting is if you don't order or put something in the the method. Your code wont register correctly. This has made me slowly but surely more conscious of how I write my code. The logic behind it makes me recognize that computers have to be specific otherwise it will break.
