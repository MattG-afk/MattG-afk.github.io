   Some people do it for the field and the perks, others to learn a new skill. For me, it's more than that. There's been a divide when it comes to the next step of society. Most believe that we will be overrun by robots or we coexist with the technology at hand( Like the Jetsons Cartoon). You can even somewhat see it in todays society with people from older generations being ousted for having issues with simple troubleshooting on the devices they have. I know for a fact, we've all had that grandparent who has asked us to "Get their phone to turn on". We begrudgingly help them out knowing they might hook us up with some extra snacks or praise. 
	 With all that in mind, I know that for me personally it's been apart of who I am. I think my generation was the first generation with computers and computer classes integrated in the classroom. Even then, I know my first computer and gaming console allowed me to think in a different way than others from the past. We are now at a tipping point for new frontiers. What I mean by this is we already have AI and VR, but what's next really excites me. Knowing that makes me want to go behind the curtain and astonish the people still looking from the otherside. It isn't like I'll ever see flying cars at full functionallity, but I do want to make my mark and be at the forefront of the new age. 
	 Another reason why I decided this career path is for the creative aspect that allows me to dive deep into how my mind works and why it gives me immense enjoyment to try to solve a problem others might have issues with. Regardless of background, politics, or creed. I believe that it doesn't matter when talking to a computer. It gives me solace knowing that the computer is unbiased and is in a sense your own playground to learn, make, and establish your mark in this world.
	 This is why I decided to study software engineering.
